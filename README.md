## Reflection

---

</br>

This was a 2 days long project built during **Dare2Develop** Hackathon organized by **Trinity Cyber Forum**. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing ourselves with documentation for new features.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, LoDash, D3, and a significant amount of JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
